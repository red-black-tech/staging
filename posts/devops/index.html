Take a look at Microsoft’s definition:\n“DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers”\nThat is not a precise enough definition to be useful. There are so many things that definition applies to, a lot of them totally unrelated to tech (think about it: Even a financial consulting company would fall under such a definition).\nI can end the post here, but I would like to explain DevOps one step deeper, as well as explain why there is a need for DevOps and where DevOps falls relative to coding.\nGreat Rec for Computer Networking [Ad] Why DevOps is so Useful Let’s start with a problem. After a coder, or more formally an Application Developer (AppDev), writes code, she needs to worry about publishing her code as well. This is the problem of the Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDL).\nThere are infinite ways to implement the SDL. The worst of which (in terms of sustainability) is to manually take the code that was written, copy it to each of the servers that will serve the application, and run them all.\nDevOps provides guidelines for implementing a more sustainable solution to SDL. The DevOps guidelines ensure code quality through automated tests and ensure application availability through mature deployment automation.\nDevOps Guidelines Below is the classic DevOps Lifecycle - a visual representation of the guidelines of DevOps.\nThe lifecycle looks like an infinity symbol because it symbolizes the fact that coding is meant to be a process that includes potentially endless revision.\ngraphic from blueprintsys.com\nAlthough this graphic makes for a good logo for DevOps, it does not provide any technical direction to a prospective engineer to figure out how DevOps works. I propose the following graphic instead:\nAfter a coder commits her code, and the code is deployed to a development environment. If all goes well, she makes a pull request to a staging environment that contains a merger of work of many coders. If the DevOps process works for the staging environment (meaning everyones’ changes played well together), then it’s ready to be merged to production. After that, the only way more code is written is if there is a new software change planned.\nThrough this graphic: one clearly sees how version control and environments tie into deployment of an application.\nThe only thing the above graphic fails to capture is how exactly these steps are defined, and how automation ties into all this. So, how exactly is the process behind graphic defined?\nThe DevOps lifecycle is usually defined through a build process file, like a Jenkinsfile or a GitHub Actions file, which exists in the same GitHub repo as code does, and that contains a literal list of steps to take given the code in the repo.\nBelow is an abstraction of a repo that contains source code (src/), tests (tests/), as well as a build process file (cicd.yaml).\nBuild process files can take many forms, but my favorite are GitHub actions files (any file under .github/workflows/ in a GitHub repo). The steps defined in the build process file are ran by a build process executor, like Jenkins, or like GitHub actions runners (the details don’t matter, just know that alonside a build process file comes a build process executor).\nExample of what a GitHub actions looks like:\non: push: branches: - main jobs: test: steps: - name: test python code run: python3 -m pytest --cov-report xml:coverage.xml --cov=./tests - name: scan code for vulnerabilities uses: sonarqube with: report: coverage.xml #scan file generate from above build: needs: [test] steps: - name: push to artifactory run: ... deploy: needs: [build] steps: - name: deploy to kubernetes uses: helm with: values_file: environments.yaml register_to_monitoring: needs: [deploy] steps: [...] # This file is not a valid GitHub actions file, it's more of an abstract image of one. # Pay attention to the files mentioned in the steps. These graphics should provide a much more informative description of DevOps that not only explains the high level DevOps steps, but that explains how an example of a DevOps pipeline in terms that engineers will understand.\nWhat is CI/CD? I propose that CI/CD are simply labels for groups of steps in the DevOps process.\nCI stands for the steps related to code, and CD stands for steps related to deployment. Put visually:\nFinal Remarks Now that we’ve defined the relationship between DevOps, AppDev, and Software Engineering, let’s make some important clarifications:\nSoftware Engineering encompasses much more than only coding DevOps is a branch of Software Engineering AppDev is a branch of Software Engineering AppDev == Software Dev WebDev and Mobile Dev are branches of AppDev A DevOps Textbook [Ad] So what does this mean for your LinkedIn Bio?\nIf you are an AppDev, write something like “Software Engineer - App Development” If you are do DevOps, write something like “Software Engineer - DevOps”.
