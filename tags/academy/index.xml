In our quest to take down popular tech buzzwords, we&amp;rsquo;re going to tackle Software Frameworks.
Definition A program that allows you to hook into itself to extend it.
That&amp;rsquo;s the one liner, but lets take it apart through an example that is your operating system.
A running operating system is a process that provides a framework for running other processes. Each process can spawn child processes, which leads to a tree/heirarchy of processes that we can view through a command like htop.</description></item><item><title>What is DevOps?</title><link>https://redblacktech.com/staging/posts/devops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 19:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://redblacktech.com/staging/posts/devops/</guid><description>Definition The subdomain of Software Engineering focused on deploying software quickly.
Simple as that.
Strangely, even though DevOps is a major buzzword in tech, many online struggle to provide a useful definition for DevOps. Take a look at Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s definition:
&amp;ldquo;DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers&amp;rdquo;
That is not a precise enough definition to be useful. There are so many things that definition applies to, a lot of them totally unrelated to tech (think about it: Even a financial consulting company would fall under such a definition).</description></item><item><title>Breadth First Search</title><link>https://redblacktech.com/staging/posts/bft/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 18:13:11 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://redblacktech.com/staging/posts/bft/</guid><description>The Algorithm Breadth first traversal (usually interchanged with breadth first search), is a graph traversal algorithm that works in a level order manner. Our graph is defined as G={V,E}, where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges.
In more intuitive words: you start from some point on a graph and expand outward one level at a time. The first level is simply one node, and the next levels are simply all the nodes near a node in the previous level (see the colorful graph on the cover of this post).</description></item></channel></rss>
