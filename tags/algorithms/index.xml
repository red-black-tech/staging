Our graph is defined as G={V,E}, where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges.
In more intuitive words: you start from some point on a graph and expand outward one level at a time. The first level is simply one node, and the next levels are simply all the nodes near a node in the previous level (see the colorful graph on the cover of this post).</description></item></channel></rss>
